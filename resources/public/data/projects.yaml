- title: grunt-simple-license
  description: >
    Every large company goes through an exercise to inspect all the open source dependencies
    and ensure that the license is agreeable to their lawyers. This plugin was started to fulfill
    just that need after we failed to get existing plugins to work. grunt-simple-license will
    read the npm or bower license metadata field and produce a report. You can also set a default
    in your project's grunt file if the authors of the package didn't add the license
    field (tisk, tisk).

- title: grunt-waitfor
  description: >
    When I started automating a series of integration tests using Vagrant as the virtual container,
    I discovered that there wasn't a good way to pause my grunt script until Vagrant was finished.
    The grunt-waitfor plugin solves this problem by blocking the grunt execution until a shell
    command (I used curl) completes successfully. The plugin was written for grunt 0.4.x.

- title: ModBox Website
  description: >
    Matt Gamboa approached me in August 2013 to help build out a simple e-commerce portal for his
    new clothing statup, ModBox. To facilitate the business, we launched a website in three weeks
    that signs users up for the service, let's them develop a fit and interest profile and securely
    captures their billing information to charge purchases to. The site was built Using node.js
    (express, jade, mongoose), MongoDB, and Stripe.

- title: Perl Module - Tk::Wizard
  description: >
    The module grew out of work being done at P&H Mining to automate various source management
    activities with PVCS. An engineering consulting group built an automation solution using C++/MFC
    for the UI and Perl for scripting the source manipulation tasks. After creating a visual framework
    around a wizard like flow, the entire code base was centralized around Perl. After the project
    was done, the source code was open sourced and published on the Internet and Lee Goddard volunteered
    to provide long term support for the module.
