        jetway.io was born out of the frustration of deploying and managing applications in AWS while we
        worked at QThru. Over the course of the year, the founding team developed two prototype products
        to ease deployment of cloud resources and ease the user identity management of those resources.
        The founders decided to close up shop in February of 2015 and move on to other opportunities.
